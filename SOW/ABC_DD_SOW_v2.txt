**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & RISK ANALYSIS**
====================================
ABC, a relatively young company (established 2014) shows significant growth between FY2024-2025, with revenue scaling to â‚¹176.97M in FY2025 from nil operations in FY2024. The company maintains a healthy shareholders' fund position of â‚¹21.84M, indicating strong equity backing, though this represents a substantial change from the previous year's â‚¹4M.

Working capital management presents a potential risk area, with current liabilities of â‚¹39.8M against current assets of â‚¹30.89M, resulting in a negative working capital position. While cash and bank balances appear healthy at â‚¹14.08M, the significant increase in other current liabilities (â‚¹38.61M) warrants careful investigation.

The company's capital structure has evolved significantly, with increased leverage and substantial growth in operations. Key risk areas include rapid operational scaling, working capital management, and the sustainability of the revenue growth trajectory. The absence of trade receivables despite significant revenue generation requires particular attention during the DD process.
